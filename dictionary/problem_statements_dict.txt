Problem 1: The "User Login Tracker" (Initialization & Updates)
The Scenario: You are managing a server. You have a dictionary where the Key is the username and the Value is the number of times they have logged in.
The Task: 1. Create a dictionary login_counts with 3 existing users.
2. Write a function record_login(user_dict, username) that:
- Checks if the user exists.
- If they exist, increment their count by 1.
- If they are new, add them to the dictionary with a count of 1 using .setdefault() or a standard assignment.
3. Update the dictionary with a batch of new users using .update().

login_counts = {"admin": 5, "dev_user": 12, "guest_1": 1}


Problem 2: The "Menu Optimizer" (Deletion & Extraction)
