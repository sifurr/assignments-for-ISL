Problem 1: The "Price Tagger"
The Challenge: You are given a list of product prices. You need to write a function that takes this list and a "Discount Percentage." Inside the function, use a list comprehension to create a new list where each price is reduced by that percentage.

prices = [100, 250, 400, 50]

Problem 2: The "Short Word" Filter
The Challenge: You have a list of words. Some are long, some are short. Create a Lambda function that checks if a word has more than 3 letters (returns True or False).
Use a List Comprehension and that Lambda to create a new list containing only the "Long Words."

words = ["hi", "python", "is", "cool", "code", "a"]
